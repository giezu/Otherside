# Otherside
My old student project, walking simulator game. Made in 2016 using Unity 5.x (don't really remember) on Linux.
Supposed to be my way to share some of my emotions (but not every part of game is part of me), but gameplay is terrible.
I focused on graphics and artstyle. Heavily inspired by modern art, Bound game and demoscene.
